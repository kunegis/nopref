: this paper does not have a derivation; we have. 
: this paper shows that scale-free degree distributions emerge from
  triadic closure.  In contrast, we show that triadic closure leads to
  preferential attachment, which is a more specific statement. 




Use the Kunegis-WebSci-12 method (pref. attachment exponent \beta) to
verify that preferential attachment exists.
