Title:  Emergence of Macro-Scale Phenomena based on Local Interactions

In this paper, we review the concept of locality in generative network
models, showing how nonlocal phenomena can arise from purely local
rules.  A graph generator is a model that describes how a graph (or
network) evolves over time, usually starting with a small seed graph and
growing over time, but it may also include the removal of edges.  Many
graph generators exist to explain the evolution of real-world graphs,
and most of them include nonlocal rules, i.e., rules that assume that
two nodes can connect randomly, without considering their preexisting
direct or indirect connections.  An example of a nonlocal rule is
preferential attachment, by which two nodes connect with a probability
proportional to their degrees.  While such models as highly successful
at explaining real-world networks, they are not satisfying as nonlocal
rules are inherently unrealistic.  Therefore, graph generators with only
local rules have been sought, and in fact it has been shown that certain
nonlocal phenomena can be explained as emerging from purely local
rules.  This papers attempts to give a precise definition of local and
nonlocal interactions in graph generators, and reviews the literature
in terms of that definitions.  We find that while local-only models have
been defined, the precise mechanisms by which nonlocality emerges have
not yet been characterised.
