----------------------- REVIEW 1 ---------------------
PAPER: 294
TITLE: The Problem of Action at a Distance in Networks and the Emergence of Preferential Attachment from Triadic Closure
AUTHORS: Jérôme Kunegis, Jun Sun and Fariba Karimi

Overall evaluation: 1 (Accept as poster)

----------- Overall evaluation -----------
The proposed model seems to follow/reproduce the well-known connection between heterogeneous degree distribution and triadic closure/transitive linking/nearest-neighbor connection. See for instance:

- "Triadic closure dynamics drives scaling laws in social multiplex networks" by Klimek and Thurner

- "Triadic closure as a basic generating mechanism of communities in complex networks" by Bianconi et al.

- "Emergence of global preferential attachment from local interaction" by Li et al.

- "Clustering and preferential attachment in growing networks" by Newman

- "Network growth by copying" by Krapivsky and Redner

Because it isn't clear what new phenomena can be understood with this model, I recommend rejection of this project for an oral presentation and suggesting a poster presentation instead.


----------------------- REVIEW 2 ---------------------
PAPER: 294
TITLE: The Problem of Action at a Distance in Networks and the Emergence of Preferential Attachment from Triadic Closure
AUTHORS: Jérôme Kunegis, Jun Sun and Fariba Karimi

Overall evaluation: 6 (Accept in whatever form the authors requested)

----------- Overall evaluation -----------
I've always thought that not enough work has been done on the dynamics of link creation at distance > 2. This piece of work aims to give a contribution in that direction. The quite surprising finding is that this "action at distance" seems to emerge from simple rules of local attachment. I would be very interested to hear more about this; I believe a large portion of the netsci audience would think the same.


----------------------- REVIEW 3 ---------------------
PAPER: 294
TITLE: The Problem of Action at a Distance in Networks and the Emergence of Preferential Attachment from Triadic Closure
AUTHORS: Jérôme Kunegis, Jun Sun and Fariba Karimi

Overall evaluation: 1 (Accept as poster)

----------- Overall evaluation -----------
I see very little novelty in this work. Purely theoretical or computational works these days are of little interest. However, the paper poses an interesting question.

RECOMMENDATION: no recommendation

I think this can be presented as a poster. Not with enough appeal for a talk.
