* We have increased the number of nodes of all experiments to n = 1000,
  in order for the degree distribution plots (as requested by Reviewer
  #1) to be more significant.  [The degree distribution plots on
  networks with n=100 show too much noise for visualisation.]  
* We rephrased the first two paragraphs of Section "Derivation", as per
  the comments of Reviewer #1. 
* We made the description of the graph generation process in Section
  "Experiments" more precise, as suggested by Reviewer #3.
* In response to the third comment of Reviewer #1, we have, in the
  Section "Experiments", added a plot (Figure 2) of the cumulated degree
  distributions for all three extremal case, and added a comparison of
  all three cases, with the observation that the degree distribution for
  the triangle closing case displays scale-free behaviour, but a tail
  not as "long" as that of the preferential attachment case.
* In the introduction, we made the description of preferential
  attachment more precise, in particular its relationship to homophily.
* We made small formulation changes as suggested by Reviewer #3.
* We have added a sentence to the beginning of the discussion to tie in
  with the new degree distribution comparison plot.
* We have added a reference (Evans 2005), as an additional example of
  previous work considering local graph growth rules, in this case based
  in random walks of fixed length.
