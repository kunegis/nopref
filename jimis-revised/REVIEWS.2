Bonjour Jérôme,

comme il y a des problèmes avec la plateforme du journal, je t'envoie les rapports des relecteurs directement par email.
Pourrais-tu, avec tes co-auteurs, prendre en compte ces dernières remarques, stp ?

De plus, tu trouveras ci-joint la classe Latex pour le format final du journal (si jamais tu as écrit en MS Word ou LibreOffice, je peux aussi t'envoyer des modèles dans ces formats-là). Pourriez-vous passer votre article à ce format, svp ? (à ce sujet : les équations sont bien numérotées dans le format du journal)

Une fois l'article révisé et reformaté, il faudrait que tu m'envoies le PDF obtenu, afin que je fasse une relecture pour la mise en forme. Ensuite, je t'indiquerai le DOI pour que tu puisses déposer la version finale sur HAL.

Cordialement,
Vincent

Reviewer #1

I think the authors performed the required modifications to their article, and I particularly like the addition of an experimental evaluation. I have only two minor modifications/questions:


Model. I still have problems with the way the model is presented. The authors added a definition of what a bipartite graph is in general, but this was not the issue. There is a contradiction that I would like to be solved: G=(V U W, E) is a bipartite graph. But the authors state "Assuming that two nodes in V connect with a probability proportional to the number of common nodes they have": in which graph do these nodes get connected? Not in G, since G is bipartite. I think the authors should explicitly distinguish, as two distinct formal objects: 1) the *actual* graph containing all nodes and links and 2) the *visible* graph containing only V and their edges. As it is presented now, they mix both points of view, which makes it hard for the reader to understand their model. And their text present contradictions, as noted in my first report.


Validation. It is nice that the authors added this experimental validation of their model. However, since the consequence of PA is supposed to be a power law distributed degree, I wonder why they did not straightforwardly study the degree distribution of their generated networks?

Moreover, the Gini index is an interesting measure, but other laws (than the power law) can result in a heterogeneous distribution, and one characteristic of the power law distribution is its heavy tail, which is not assessed by this measure.


Reviewer #2

As the paper was already very interesting in its previous version, I strongly recommend his publication. The claim of the paper that preferential attachment may be derived from triadic closure was already proved as realistic theoretically. The experiments on synthetics graphs show that heterogeneity of the degree distribution can also be obtained with triadic closure. The paper is well written, clear, and it brings an interesting research question.


Reviewer #3

Here are my comments to the new version of the paper:

 

The paper has improved and beneficiated from the inclusion of the new section reporting some experiments. I only have a few really minor comments.

·        Page 1, line 27. Initiating a new paragraph with “By contrast to THIS,” would be clear if the authors could explicit what they mean by “THIS”.

·        Page 2, line 29-30. “The concept of preferential attachment is USED to explain …”

·        Page 8, line 20-31. The graph generation process in not completely clear.

·        Page 9, line 12. “degrees”
