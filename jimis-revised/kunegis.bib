% Works by Jérôme Kunegis. 
%
% Papers are divided into those where I am a primary and secondary
% author.  Primary author does not necessarily mean first author.  I
% understand "primary author" as someone taking the initiative in
% writing a paper, and as a secondary author someone who gives guidance
% or contributes in another way (e.g. a dataset, code, etc.).  The
% distinction is blurred in newer papers
%
% Ordering is from oldest to newest. 
%
% We include the main URL via the 'url' field, and other URLs via
